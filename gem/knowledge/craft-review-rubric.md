# Craft Review Rubric

Read this in full when running Pass 3 (craft review) of `copydesk-write` mode, after Pass 2 (prose advisory review) has already run. It is a reference, not a script — apply it by judgment.

You are evaluating writing for craft depth beyond surface-level correctness. Pass 2 catches AI patterns and banned phrases. This pass is different: it evaluates whether the writing achieves the deeper craft goals that separate competent prose from memorable prose. You are not checking for errors here. You are checking for missed opportunities.

## What you're evaluating

### 1. Aphoristic destination sentences

Does the piece end on a sentence that travels? A good destination sentence names the conclusion in a portable form that readers carry with them. It synthesizes, it doesn't just restate.

**Weak ending (fact-restatement):**
> The policy failed because enforcement was inconsistent and penalties were too low.

**Strong ending (portable conclusion):**
> Negligence with receipts. That's what it was. A rule on letterhead, four inspectors for two thousand facilities, and a penalty nobody was ever paid to collect. Negligence with receipts.

Look at the final 1-2 sentences of each section and the piece overall. If they merely summarize what was already said, flag the opportunity. The fix is not to add a platitude. The fix is to find what the argument actually proved and name it in a form someone would repeat.

In advocacy and explainer pieces, section endings that restate the evidence or circle back to the thesis are especially damaging. These genres should end sections with a sentence that synthesizes, not summarizes. The best analytical writing builds entire sections to deliver a single portable line. Section endings should land on the structural pattern named, not the evidence re-cited. If an advocacy section ends by restating the facts, or an explainer section ends by re-describing the concept, flag it as a missed destination.

### 2. Naming unnamed concepts

Does the piece introduce patterns, dynamics, or insights without giving them a name? Named concepts travel. Unnamed concepts don't.

The best concept names become part of how people think. A 2-4 word label that compresses a complex dynamic into something portable and immediately recognizable. The name makes the pattern discussable.

**Detection heuristic:** Read the piece looking for any passage of 2+ sentences that describes a recurring dynamic, structural pattern, hidden incentive, behavioral tendency, or central mechanism without ever compressing it into a 2-4 word label. These are naming opportunities. Every piece longer than 300 words should have at least one named concept. If zero concepts are named, flag it as the highest-priority craft gap.

**Unnamed (the description floats without a handle):**
> Companies keep making the product worse for users while extracting more value for shareholders, and users stay because switching costs are too high.

**Named (the description becomes portable):**
> Call it "compliance theater": a policy technically exists but nobody enforces it, creating a zone where everyone pretends the rules matter while acting as if they don't.

**What makes a good name:** It compresses the insight into something a reader could use in conversation tomorrow. A good name works because you can say it to someone and they immediately get it. A good name feels inevitable after you hear it, like the pattern was always waiting for that label. Critically, the name must be genuinely novel: a combination of words that hasn't appeared in this form before. Generic category labels ("the accountability gap," "the transparency problem," "the trust deficit") are not names. They're descriptions. A good test: could this name appear in any article on a vaguely similar topic? If yes, it's too generic. "Compliance theater" is specific to a particular insight about unenforced policy. "The quiet veto" is specific to blocking decisions by withholding participation rather than objecting. These are novel combinations that couldn't appear in any generic article on a similar topic. Flag generic labels as failed naming attempts.

### 3. Central-point dwelling

Does the piece dwell on its load-bearing point, or does it treat all points with equal depth? AI-generated writing distributes attention evenly across evidence. Human writers are obsessive: they find the one thing that matters most and give it disproportionate space, circling back to it, restating it in different frames, letting it breathe.

**Checklist-shaped (equal depth, no dwelling):**
> The policy failed for three reasons. First, enforcement was inconsistent. Second, penalties were too low. Third, public awareness was minimal.

**Dwelling-shaped (one point carries the argument):**
> The policy failed because nobody enforced it. The penalties existed on paper. The public awareness campaign ran for six months. But enforcement? The state assigned four inspectors to cover 2,000 facilities. Four. The staffing was the confession.

If the piece has 3+ major points all receiving roughly equal treatment and none of them gets returned to, restated, or given extra space, flag it. The fix isn't to cut points. It's to identify which point is load-bearing and restructure the piece so the other points serve it.

### 4. Structural literary devices

Does the piece use metaphor, understatement, irony, or hyperbole in a way that carries argumentative weight? A structural literary device is one where removing it would lose meaning, not just style. Decorative metaphors don't count.

**Decorative (does no argumentative work):**
> The policy landscape is a minefield of competing interests.

**Structural (the metaphor IS the argument):**
> "Every committee starts as a conversation and ends as a ritual. First the members argue about substance. Then they argue about process. Then they stop arguing and just repeat the process. The meeting becomes the purpose of the meeting." The life-cycle metaphor structures the entire analysis.

In explainer and analytical pieces, look for at least one literary device per major section that does real work. If an explainer is technically clean but literarily flat (no metaphors, no irony, no understatement, no hyperbole), flag it. Technically clean + literarily flat is a strong AI signature in analytical writing.

In personal essays and narrative pieces, the lived experience and voice often do the work that literary devices do elsewhere. Don't flag a personal essay for missing metaphors if the concrete details and personal voice are already carrying the meaning. Flag only if the piece feels generic or voiceless despite the personal framing.

### 5. Human-moment anchoring

Does the piece ground its abstractions in specific human moments? Not just data or examples, but scenes with a person in a situation. The difference between "switching costs are high" and "How were you and your 200 Facebook friends ever gonna agree on when it was time to leave Facebook, and where to go?" is the difference between explanation and experience. If a major abstraction floats free of any human story, flag it. The fix is one specific person or scene, not more data.

## Self-check your own suggestions (discipline gate)

Every concrete line you propose (an aphoristic destination, a named concept, a sample closer, a rewritten sentence) is text the user may paste in verbatim. So your suggestions are held to the same banned-pattern discipline as the prose itself — the exact rules in the main instruction text's Always-Active Rules section. A suggestion that smuggles in a banned pattern is an objective defect, not a craft contribution. Before you emit any proposed line, run it through these checks and rewrite until it passes:

- **The fatal pattern.** Never propose a line built on "This isn't X. This is Y.", "That's not X, it's Y.", "Not X. Y." (including fragments like "Not corruption, not ideology. Just Z."), "Forget X, this is Y", or any construction that negates one framing and then asserts the corrected one, including across two sentences. Your aphoristic-destination and naming suggestions are the highest-risk spot: the punchy closer you reach for is most often a negation-correction.
- **Em dashes.** Never, in any proposed line. Use a comma, period, semicolon, or parentheses.
- **Banned phrases.** No AI vocabulary or ChatGPT-isms ("delve", "it's worth noting", "look,", "let's be honest", "sit with", and the rest of the banned list).

If your sharpest version of a suggestion can only be written with a banned pattern, give the direction in plain words instead of a paste-ready line. Say "name what these facts mean for the reader in a portable phrase" rather than handing over a sample that uses the fatal pattern. Discipline wins on banned patterns.

## Output format

For each dimension, report one of:
- **Strong** — the piece does this well, with a brief note on what works
- **Opportunity** — the piece misses this, with the specific passage, a direction, and a proposed improvement
- **N/A** — the dimension doesn't apply to this piece (e.g., a 100-word social post doesn't need aphoristic destinations)

| Dimension | Rating | Notes | Proposed improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| [dimension] | Strong/Opportunity/N/A | [specific passage and what's wrong or right] | [concrete suggestion for how to improve, if Opportunity] |

**Overall craft depth:** One sentence summarizing whether the piece achieves memorable prose or stays at competent-but-forgettable.
