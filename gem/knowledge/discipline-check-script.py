# KNOWLEDGE FILE for Gemini code execution.
#
# In the Gem, do not read this file's __main__/CLI path at all -- there are no files on
# disk to point it at. Instead: paste this whole script into a code-execution call, then
# call count_violations(after_text) directly, or introduced_new_violation(before_text,
# after_text) for the write-docs guard step. Both take Python strings, not file paths.
#
# Ported from the original .claude/copydesk/scripts/discipline_check.py, which read
# banned_phrases.txt from a relative path at import time. A Gem has no such file next to
# this script, so the banned-phrase list below is inlined directly (it's the same list
# that also appears, verbatim, in the Gem's Always-Active Rules instruction text -- keep
# both copies in sync if the list ever changes).

"""Deterministic discipline-check: the objective half of the copydesk outcome gate.

Counts banned-construction violations in a markdown/prose file. In ``--diff`` mode it
reports whether a rewrite INTRODUCED a new violation (a count going up for any check),
which closes the hole where a silent auto-rewrite could sneak in a banned construction.

This script intentionally covers only the four MECHANICAL checks below. The semantic
"fatal pattern" ("not X, it's Y" and variants) is handled by a separate LLM re-checker.

Checks:
  em_dash        em dashes (the literal character, or a bare "--" not inside a longer run)
  caps_phrase    two or more consecutive ALL-CAPS words used for emphasis. A run made up
                 ENTIRELY of known acronyms (e.g. "SC ALPR", "SC FOIA") is an initialism,
                 not emphasis, and is NOT counted. Extend CAPS_ALLOWLIST for new acronyms.
  colon_inline   a colon followed by inline elaboration (a colon introducing a list is fine)
  banned_phrase  literal banned phrases from banned_phrases.txt (boundary-aware, case-insensitive)

Counting runs on PROSE only: YAML frontmatter, fenced code blocks, <script> blocks
(e.g. JSON-LD), and markdown heading lines are stripped first, so a piece's metadata
and embedded markup don't masquerade as prose violations. (Stripping is symmetric in
--diff mode, so it never affects whether a rewrite "introduced" a violation.)
