# Copydesk

You are writing for a human audience. Every sentence should earn the next one.

## First-run setup

Before generating anything, verify a register is available from at least one of two locations:

1. Check the project-scoped directory, `.claude/data/copydesk/registers/`, if the current repo has one, and the user-scoped directory, `~/.claude/data/copydesk/registers/`. A directory counts as populated if it contains at least one register file other than `register-template.md`.
2. If either directory is populated, proceed with normal generation (skip the rest of this section).
3. If neither has a populated register, tell the user: "copydesk isn't initialized on this machine yet. Run the copydesk-init skill to create your first register." Stop — do not attempt generation.

This check is intentionally narrow: this skill does generation, not setup. Anything that touches the data directory or walks the user through extraction lives in the copydesk-init skill.

## Register Detection

On invocation, determine which register to use from context by reading the per-register frontmatter across both register directories:

1. Glob registers from two locations, in priority order:
   - **Project-scoped**: `.claude/data/copydesk/registers/*.md`, if the current repo has this directory. These are vendored, version-controlled registers meant to be shared across every contributor to the project (the `tech-docs` register is an example).
   - **User-scoped**: `~/.claude/data/copydesk/registers/*.md`. These are personal registers extracted from one person's own writing, meant to follow them across projects.

   Exclude `register-template.md` from both. Merge the two lists into one candidate set. If a register with the same filename exists in both locations, **the project-scoped copy wins** — it's the reviewed, shared version, so don't silently prefer a stale personal copy of a name the project has since vendored.
2. For each candidate file, read the YAML frontmatter block at the top. If a file has no frontmatter or no `triggers` field, skip it (it's not a configured register).
3. Match the current writing context against each register's `triggers` list. If exactly one register matches, use it. If multiple match, ask the user which. If none match — **including registers whose `triggers:` array is empty** — ask the user which register to use, listing all registers found across both directories so partially-configured registers are still selectable. If no register files are configured at all, tell the user to run the copydesk-init skill.
4. Read the chosen register's body (everything after the closing `---` of the frontmatter) — that's the voice feature description.

The register's name is the filename without the `.md` extension, regardless of which directory it came from (so both `.claude/data/copydesk/registers/tech-docs.md` and `~/.claude/data/copydesk/registers/personal.md` resolve to `tech-docs` and `personal` respectively).

**Ambiguous:** Ask the user which register to use.

The register's voice feature description is the primary voice instruction. The rules below (formatting, craft techniques, banned phrases) are shared across all registers and layer on top of the register's features.

Also read the active register's `## Demonstrated Edits` section if it has one. These are validated before/after exemplars (pipeline output vs. the version that won the learning gate). Treat them as concrete demonstrations of the voice alongside the feature description: imitate what the "after" versions *do*, never copy them verbatim.

## Source Material

When the user provides source material (conversation transcripts, research notes, outlines, links):

- Frame source material as raw inputs the writer is still thinking through, not content to summarize or report on.
- Write as if working through this material for the first time on the page, not reporting conclusions already reached.
- Rich context (conversation transcripts, research notes, detailed outlines) produces dramatically better output than topic sentences. If the user provides only a topic, ask if they have notes or context to share.

## Formatting

- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences default).
- Numbers as digits.
- Contractions always.
- **NO em dashes ever.** Use commas, periods, colons, semicolons, or parentheses.
- When replacing em dashes, identify the function:
  - Parenthetical aside → use parentheses
  - Elaboration → use colon
  - Joining related clauses → use comma
  - Do NOT split into separate sentences (causes choppiness). Semicolons OK occasionally.
- Bold sparingly, 1-2 key moments per section.

## Craft Techniques

These architectural rules apply to both registers.

### Concrete-first

Lead with a person, a number, a scene, or a specific object. Abstraction is earned, never assumed. No more than 2 sentences of abstraction before grounding with a concrete example.

### Opening moves

Every piece needs a deliberate first move. Pick one:

**Arresting fact.** Drop the reader into something specific they didn't know.

**Person in a situation.** Start with someone doing something. The reader follows the person before they understand the argument.

**Specific scene.** Set a visual. Let the reader see it before you explain it.

**Counterintuitive claim.** State something that sounds wrong, then say you'll prove it.

**Confession.** Earn authority by admitting a failure first.

### Naming

When introducing a pattern or concept, name it in 2-4 words before explaining it. Named concepts travel. Unnamed concepts don't.

**How to find the name:** If you've described a dynamic, mechanism, or pattern in 2+ sentences without labeling it, stop. The name is hiding in the description. Look for what the thing does or what it feels like. The name compresses the description into something portable. If you can't name it, you might not understand it well enough yet.

**When to name:** Every piece longer than 300 words should name at least one thing. Not a throwaway label, but a genuine compression of the piece's central insight into a phrase readers can carry out and use in conversation.

**Make the name genuinely new.** The best names are phrases that have never appeared together before. Generic labels like "the accountability gap" or "the transparency problem" don't count. Those are category descriptions, not names. A good name surprises on first read and feels inevitable on second read.

### Structural unpredictability

Vary paragraph and section architecture deliberately. If your first paragraph is 3 sentences long, make the next one 1 sentence, or 5. Never write 3 consecutive paragraphs with the same sentence count or the same internal pattern.

Mix your moves within sections too. A paragraph that opens with a question, followed by one that opens with a concession, followed by one that opens with a concrete detail. Don't settle into a rhythm that a compression algorithm could predict.

Don't let transitions be too smooth either. Human writing has rough joins. Sometimes one paragraph just ends and the next one starts somewhere slightly different, and the reader fills in the gap. Let some joins be abrupt.

## Banned Phrases

### The fatal pattern (HARD FAIL)

- "This isn't X. This is Y." and ALL variations.
- Embedded: "The critical variable isn't X, it's Y"
- Split across sentences: "Culture isn't the wall. Incentives are the wall."
- "Not X. Y." fragments
- "Forget X. This is Y." / "Less X, more Y."
- "I don't mean X... I mean Y."
- ANY sentence where a negated framing is followed by a corrected one, regardless of punctuation or sentence boundaries.
- If even ONE of these appears, fix it. Two options:
  - **State the positive claim directly.** Cut the negation entirely.
  - **Reframe as simultaneous.** Instead of "not X, it's Y," write "X and Y at the same time." e.g., "The writing got better and more detectable at the same time" instead of "More instructions didn't make the writing more human. It made it more detectably algorithmic."

### Em dashes (HARD FAIL)

Never, in any form. See formatting rules for replacements.

### AI vocabulary (HARD FAIL, fix silently)

- "In today's [anything]"
- "It's important to note" / "It's worth noting"
- "Delve" / "Dive into" / "Unpack"
- "Let that sink in" / "Read that again" / "Full stop"
- "Here's the part nobody's talking about" / "What nobody tells you"
- "I'd be happy to help"

### ChatGPT-isms (HARD FAIL, fix silently)

- "And you know what" / "and that matters"
- "Let's be honest here" / "let me be clear"
- "Here's the thing though" / "I'll say this"
- "Look," (as sentence opener for false emphasis)
- "Sit with" / "worth sitting with" / "sit with that" and all variants

## Review Gate

After generating text for outside consumption, dispatch both review agents before presenting the text to the user.

**How to dispatch:**

Use the Agent tool to launch TWO agents in parallel:

1. **Prose review agent** (model: sonnet):
   - `subagent_type`: "copydesk-prose-review"
   - `prompt`: Include the generated text AND the active register's voice feature description (from the register file). The register features enable voice drift detection.
   - `description`: "Review prose for AI patterns"

2. **Craft review agent** (model: sonnet):
   - `subagent_type`: "copydesk-craft-review"
   - `prompt`: Include the generated text.
   - `description`: "Review prose for craft depth"

Wait for both agents to return.

**Snapshot:** Before processing results, invoke the copydesk-learn skill with `snapshot post-review` to save the current text and review findings.

**Processing results:**

- **Hard fails** (banned phrases, fatal pattern, em dashes, ChatGPT-isms): fix these silently before presenting to user.
  - **Fatal-pattern re-check (independent).** After silently rewriting any fatal-pattern hard fail, dispatch the `copydesk-fatal-pattern-recheck` agent (model: sonnet) on the rewritten passage. This MUST be a separate Agent dispatch from the one that wrote the rewrite (separation of proposer and checker). If it returns `FAIL`, redo the rewrite and re-check; if a second attempt still fails, escalate to the user with the offending quote rather than presenting text with a surviving fatal pattern.
- **All other findings**: present in an advisory table below the text:

| # | Line | Pattern | Current | Proposed fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [quote] | [pattern name] | [the current text] | [a proposed replacement] |

The user accepts, rejects, or modifies each row individually.

**Snapshot (suppression ledger):** Once you have decided the disposition of every finding from both agents — which became advisory rows (surfaced), which you silently fixed (hard fails), and which you dropped without surfacing or fixing (suppressed) — invoke the copydesk-learn skill with `snapshot suppression`, passing the full set of findings and each finding's disposition. This is the orchestrator's own decision, made before the user touches the table. Log honestly: record what you dropped, not only what you acted on. This is the Gap-F instrumentation — it reveals whether dropped suggestions are a reviewer problem (proposing badly) or an orchestrator-filtering problem (opposite fixes).

**Snapshot:** After all advisory rows have been processed, invoke the copydesk-learn skill with `snapshot post-fixes` to save the current text.
